# Azure Core JDK HTTP plugin library for Java

This is an azure-core HTTP client that makes use of the asynchronous HttpClient that was made generally available as 
part of JDK 11. 

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- A [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk_link], version 12 or later.

### Include the package
#### Include the BOM file

Please include the azure-sdk-bom to your project to take dependency on the General Availability (GA) version of the library. In the following snippet, replace the {bom_version_to_target} placeholder with the version number.
To learn more about the BOM, see the [AZURE SDK BOM README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/boms/azure-sdk-bom/README.md).

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
            <artifactId>azure-sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{bom_version_to_target}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```
and then include the direct dependency in the dependencies section without the version tag.

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-core-http-jdk-httpclient</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Include direct dependency
If you want to take dependency on a particular version of the library that is not present in the BOM,
add the direct dependency to your project as follows.

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;com.azure:azure-core-http-jdk-httpclient;current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-core-http-jdk-httpclient</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.5</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

## Key concepts

## Examples

The following sections provide several code snippets covering some of the most common client configuration scenarios.

- [Create a Simple Client](#create-a-simple-client)
- [Create a Client with Proxy](#create-a-client-with-proxy)

### Create a Simple Client

Create a HttpClient.

```java readme-sample-createBasicClient
HttpClient client = new JdkHttpClientBuilder().build();
```

Create a HttpClient using a connection timeout of 60 seconds.

```java readme-sample-createClientWithConnectionTimeout
HttpClient client = new JdkHttpClientBuilder().connectionTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(60)).build();
```

### Create a Client with Proxy

Create a HttpClient that is using a proxy.

```java readme-sample-createProxyClient
HttpClient client = new JdkHttpClientBuilder()
    .proxy(new ProxyOptions(ProxyOptions.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress("<proxy-host>", 8888)))
    .build();
```

## Next steps

Get started with Azure libraries that are [built using Azure Core](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/#java).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any bugs, please file issues via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/new/choose)
or checkout [StackOverflow for Azure Java SDK](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure-java-sdk).

### Enabling Logging

Azure SDKs for Java provide a consistent logging story to help aid in troubleshooting application errors and expedite
their resolution. The logs produced will capture the flow of an application before reaching the terminal state to help
locate the root issue. View the [logging][logging] wiki for guidance about enabling logging.
